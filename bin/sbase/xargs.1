.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads space, tab, newline and EOF delimited strings from stdin
and executes the specified
.Ar cmd
with the strings as
.Ar arguments .
.Pp
Any arguments specified on the command line are given to the command upon
each invocation, followed by some number of the arguments read from
stdin.
The command is repeatedly executed one or more times until stdin is exhausted.
.Pp
Spaces, tabs and newlines may be embedded in arguments using single (`'')
or double (`"') quotes or backslashes ('\\').
Single quotes escape all non-single quote characters, excluding newlines, up
to the matching single quote.
Double quotes escape all non-double quote characters, excluding newlines, up
to the matching double quote.
Any single character, including newlines, may be escaped by a backslash.
