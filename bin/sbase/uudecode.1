.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads
.Ar file
and writes a decoded version to the file specified in the uuencoded header.
In case the file already exists, it is truncated.
Otherwise a new file is created.
The permissions of the created/accessed file are changed to reflect the
mode in the header.
If no
.Ar file
is given
.Nm
reads from stdin.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl m
Use Base64 for decoding.
.It Fl o Ar output
Write to
.Ar output
rather than the file specified in the header.

.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
For safety uudecode operates on regular files and stdout only.
Trying to uudecode to a link, directory, or special file
yields an error.

The
.Nm
utility is compliant with the
.St -p1003.1-2013
specification.

The
