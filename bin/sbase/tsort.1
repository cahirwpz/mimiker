The result is not optimized for any particular usage.
Loops are detected and reported to standard error, but does not stop the
sort.
.Pp
The input is a list of edges (vertex pairs), where
the edge is directed from the first vertex to the
second vertex.
.Sh OPTIONS
None.

The graph as successfully sorted.
.It 1
The graph as successfully sorted, but contained loops.
.It > 1
