sbase - suckless unix tools
===========================

sbase is a collection of unix tools that are inherently portable across
UNIX and UNIX-like systems.

The complement of sbase is ubase[1] which is Linux-specific and provides
all the non-portable tools. Together they are intended to form a base
system similar to busybox but much smaller and suckless.

Building
--------

To build sbase, simply type make. You may have to fiddle with config.mk
depending on your system.

You can also build sbase-box, which generates a single binary containing
all the required tools. You can then symlink the individual tools to
sbase-box or run: make sbase-box-install

Ideally you will want to statically link sbase. If you are on Linux we
recommend using musl-libc[2].

Portability
-----------

sbase has been compiled on a variety of different operating systems,
including Linux, *BSD, OSX, Haiku, Solaris, SCO OpenServer and others.

Various combinations of operating systems and architectures have also
been built.

You can build sbase with gcc, clang, tcc, nwcc and pcc.

Status
------

The following tools are implemented:

'#'  -> UTF-8 support, '=' -> Implicit UTF-8 support, '*' -> Finished,
'|'  -> Audited,       'o' -> POSIX 2013 compliant,   'x' -> Non-POSIX,
'0'  -> NUL handling,  '()' -> Petty flag
