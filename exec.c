  /* This is a simple demonstration of the exec functionality. It
   * requests to substitute current thread's image with program
   * called "prog", which is implemented in ./user/prog.c, and after
   * compilation embedded in the kernel image.

   * As the loaded program has no means to communicate with the
   * system, because system calls are not yet implemented, it runs
   * quietly. To test its behavior with a debugger, after starting
   * gdb issue the command:
   *    add-symbol-file user/prog.uelf 0x00400000
   * which will load the symbols for the user program. You may then
   * e.g. break at its main(), and see that argc and argv are set
   * correctly. If you let it run further, you may `print textarea`
   * to see that it accesses a string in .data and copies it to
   * .bss.
