This directory contains procedures that demonstrate some of kernel
features. They are meant to serve as functionality proofs and
examples, and therefore are a valuable documentation.

When designing and/or implementing a new interface, you are welcome to
drop an example usage in this directory.

These files are not compiled by default, if you wish to run a
demonstration, you need to compile and call it on your own.
