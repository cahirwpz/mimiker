We use various labels for marking Github issues and pull requests, as it helps managing them. This article is an attempt at formalizing the meaning of these labels.

---

 - ![#e11d21](https://placehold.it/15/e11d21/000000?text=+) `important` - This issue/PR is of topmost priority. It may be a major critical bug, or a feature that must be ready ASAP.
 - ![#fef2c0](https://placehold.it/15/fef2c0/000000?text=+) `bug` - This entry concerns a problem with existing code that requires fixing.
 - ![#207de5](https://placehold.it/15/207de5/000000?text=+) `feature` - This entry introduces new functionality that needs to be implemented.
 - ![#207de5](https://placehold.it/15/207de5/000000?text=+) `cleanup` - Neither a bug fix or a feature, but improves code structure or readability.

 - ![#e95f0b](https://placehold.it/15/e95f0b/000000?text=+) `maintainer` - You'll be asked to mark you PR with this label if project maintainer requests to take it over in order to edit it and merge with `master`.
 - ![#fad8c7](https://placehold.it/15/fad8c7/000000?text=+) `not ready` - We believe this is not the right time to work on this issue/PR, either because discussion is needed, or some infrastructure or interfaces are missing.
 - ![#fad8c7](https://placehold.it/15/fad8c7/000000?text=+) `blocked` - Work on this entry cannot continue, because some other PR/issue must be completed first.
 - ![#fad8c7](https://placehold.it/15/fad8c7/000000?text=+) `too big` - This PR is too big to be reviewed in one go. You'll be asked to split it into smaller ones. 
 - ![#0e8a16](https://placehold.it/15/0e8a16/000000?text=+) `WIP` - Work in progress (usually applied to pull requests). The developer of this branch is still working on it. If you review it or share your opinions, keep in mind this branch may be subject to major changes.

 - ![#a020f0](https://placehold.it/15/a020f0/000000?text=+) `mockup` - (usually applied to pull requests) This branch is not supposed to be merged, and only provides a demonstration of a feature or an interface.
 - ![#a020f0](https://placehold.it/15/a020f0/000000?text=+) `research` - This task doesn't require writing source code, but investigating solutions or tools available.
 - ![#cc317c](https://placehold.it/15/cc317c/000000?text=+) `question` - This entry is used for discussion, not actual development.
 - ![#bfe5bf](https://placehold.it/15/bfe5bf/000000?text=+) `proposal` - We have not decided yet (or the author does not know) whether the branch is worth merging, or whether the issue is valid.
 - ![#bfd4f2](https://placehold.it/15/bfd4f2/000000?text=+) `wish` - This task is of low priority, and may have a very vague description.
 - ![#ffffff](https://placehold.it/15/ffffff/000000?text=+) `wontfix` - We've decided not to fix the bug, either because it is invalid, unfixable, or fixing it does not follow our general agenda.
