# New tags semantic

## General info

- Tags are meant to help us organize our code
- When you are about to write a comment that requires
  special attention, please add an adequate tag to mark it
- We use Markdown syntax
- Shortcuts used below
  - `?a` - authors nick
  - `?s` - name of source from which code have been taken
  - `?t` - term

## Description changes

- **FIXME(?a)** - info about needed fixes, that we are aware about, but
  we leave it be
- **TODO(?a)** - info about some unimplemented features for
  the time being, less obliging than GitHub Issue
- **XXX(?a)** - explanation for some non-obvious part of code, some *HACK*
- **START OF ?s CODE / END OF ?s CODE** - marks foreign part of code
  (you're obliged to leave info about where is it taken from along
  with specific link)

## New tag

- **INFO(?t)** - comment documenting given term, occurs exactly once
