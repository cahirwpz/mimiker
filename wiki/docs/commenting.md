# How do we comment our code?

- We use [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf)
  syntax inside C-style comments.

## Tags

Tags are meant to help us mark important things in our code.
When you are about to write a comment that requires special
attention, please add an adequate tag to mark it.

Wildcards used below:
 - `?a`: author's nick
 - `?s`: name of source from which code have been taken
 - `?t`: term to be described

List of tags:
 - `FIXME(?a)`: info about needed fixes, that we are aware about,
   but we leave it be
 - `TODO(?a)`: info about some unimplemented features for
   the time being, less obliging than GitHub Issue
 - `XXX(?a)`: explanation for some non-obvious part of code,
   perhaps a hack
 - `START OF ?s CODE` and `END OF ?s CODE`: marks foreign part of code,
   you **must** leave info about where is it taken from along
   with specific link
 - `INFO(?t)`: describes given term, must occur exactly once in the code
