/*
 * Explanation of t_rocol and t_rocount:
 * In canonical mode, the line that the user is typing can be echoed back
 * to the serial device, so that the user knows what they're typing.
 * However, processes can still write to the terminal, so the echoed line
 * can be interleaved with output from processes.
 * When the user wants to erase characters from the line, we only want to
 * rub out (i.e. make no longer visible) characters that the user has typed,
 * but we must preserve characters output by processes.
 * For example, suppose the user types 'foo', a process outputs 'qux', and
 * then the user types 'bar'. The line on the display device should look like
 * this:
 * fooquxbar
 * Note that the contents of the line buffer are 'foobar'.
 * We can safely erase 'bar' from the line, since it's uninterrupted by output
 * from processes. After the user presses the erase key 3 times, the line on the
 * display device will look like this:
 * fooqux
 * Now, what should happen when the user presses the erase key? We must preserve
 * the 'qux' output by the process, since that's not recoverable. We therefore
 * re-echo the contents of the line buffer (with the last character removed) to
 * the screen:
 * fooqux
 * fo
 * Clearly, we need to be able to tell when it's safe to rub out the last
 * character in the line buffer. More precisely, we need to know whether the
 * last character on the line displayed to the user comes from the user
 * or from a process. We therefore keep track of the longest suffix
 * of the line buffer that was echoed to the screen uninterrupted.
 * The length of that suffix is stored in t_rocount, and the column index
 * of the first character in the suffix is stored in t_rocol.
 * When a character typed by the user is echoed, we increment t_rocount.
 * When a process outputs any character, t_rocount is set to 0.
 * Erasing a character decrements t_rocount.
 * When t_rocount > 0, we know we can safely erase the last character
 * in the line buffer. When t_rocount == 0, we must re-echo the line buffer.
